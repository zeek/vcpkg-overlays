# vcpkg-overlays

This repo contains overlay files for vcpkg. This allows us to build various
vcpkg ports from local submodule directories instead of using remote
repositories. Most of these overlays are copies of packages from the official
vcpkg repository, with local changes to use with Zeek and related repos.
